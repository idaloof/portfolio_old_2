My hobby
====================

My greatest and most time consuming hobby is music, whether it is dancing to music or creating music. In 2013 I first started enjoying techno music.
The rough rhythms and minimal melodies had me bouncing up and down and since then it has been a passion.
The best part about music is that it brings people together, regardless of genre.
For this reason I have music playing whenever possible and my greatest object in life is transferring my love of music to my children.
In about 12-15 years, I hope that I can take my whole family to a techno festival. How about that?!
