About me
==========================

Hi!
My name is Martin Fooladi and I am a first year student at BTH.
Before starting this education, I worked as a teacher in physics and mathematics for 7th, 8th and 9th grade students at Vimarskolan in Vimmerby.

I really loved my work, but at the same time I was yearning for an education that was more technical, which would coincide with my abilities and my personality even more.

Vimmerby is where I currently reside with my family: Evelina (partner), Rio (7 years) and Nora (4 years).

Apart from being a full time student, I also work as the IT guy at Folkh√∂gskolan here in Vimmerby.
It's a great part time job, because I get to help people and I don't need to bring my work home.

In my spare time I make awesome vegan dishes and make techno music. Techno music works well in all situations. 

* Cooking
* Dancing
* Working
* Studying 

You name it! Drums and bass for the win.
